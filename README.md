# SeaSwiftAndSun-Simplon

The aim of this application is to help users discover surf spots worldwide through the utilization of a list and an interactive map. 

[Requirement]: This project was undertaken as part of the preparation for the professional title of Application Designer and Developer, with a collaborative effort from a team of three students.

# BDD
## Database with Airtable

This project was to integrate with [Database Surf Destinations  Airtable](https://api.airtable.com/v0/app0uFVsj3OmbD18z/Surf%20Destinations).

In order to enhance the functionality of the application, we sought to establish a connection with an Airtable database, allowing for a dynamic and up-to-date surf spot list.
